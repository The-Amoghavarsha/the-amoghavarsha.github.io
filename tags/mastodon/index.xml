      <description>Mastodon is a Twitter-like micro-blogging platform. There are a lot of tweaks that you can make on Masto, as it&amp;rsquo;s free and open-source software. It provides you with a way to verify your websites on the platform in an indie web-style way.
What Does It Mean? Imagine you have a personal blog or a website, obviously hosted on the web. So it is your online identity.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s say, you also have other social media, and generally you would like to provide a link to your personal website or blog in the bio/description.</description>
